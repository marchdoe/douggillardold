Remember those we lost at Bowling Green. 
Doug March, get ready for August By Cake and a project called "Cash Rivers" coming out soon. 

Haha, I like what you have done here.

I am really into a band called Dick Diver right now, the weird thing is I can't stand the name, I can't stand the album art, but man, the music is really good.
