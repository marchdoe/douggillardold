doug is a person making music in new york and other places. Also touring a lot. he was born in 1892 in a sharecropper's outhouse and learned to play by stretching a piece of cornsilk across a possum carcass, pressing down on the atrophied teats for frets. the sound wasn;t bad, and rumor has it Johnny B. Goode took guitar lessons from him upom hearing the possum-tar.
